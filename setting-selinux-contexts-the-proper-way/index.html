<h1><a href="/">Dan Donoghue</a> <strong>Setting SELinux Contexts the Proper Way</strong></h1>


	


<p>Almost every mention of SELinux Contexts online references the use of <code>chcon(1)</code> for setting contexts on file and directories. This is a pretty shit way of setting contexts, since these changes don&rsquo;t stay when the file system is relabeled, and with <code>chcon(1)</code> the contexts need to be manually set again after an OS reinstallation.</p>

<p>The proper way to set contexts is to use <code>semanage(8)</code>, which appends a new line with the rule to <code>/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.local</code>. Real useful, since the relabelling of a file-system will follow whatever rules are specified within this file, and it&rsquo;s far easier to copy the <code>file_contexts.local</code> file than it would be to manually run <code>chcon(1)</code> after a relabel/reinstallation.</p>

<p>Setting contexts with <code>semanage(8)</code> and <code>restorecon(8)</code> is actually a lot less effort than using <code>chcon(1)</code>, mainly because you don&rsquo;t have to specify the context after the first command. I&rsquo;ll give an example. Say you have a directory <code>/mnt/storage/My Files</code> that you want to share via Samba, well it needs the <code>samba_share_t</code> context. To give it this context with <code>chcon(1)</code> you&rsquo;d run <code>chcon -t samba_share_t /mnt/storage/My\ Files</code>, which does work. Now you&rsquo;re copying a load of files from some other directory into the &ldquo;My Files&rdquo; directory, these all need the <code>samba_share_t</code> context, so you&rsquo;ve got to run <code>chcon -t samba_share_t /mnt/storage/My\ Files -R</code> to set the correct context. That&rsquo;s a bit of a mouthful.</p>

<p>Using <code>semanage(8)</code>, this could be reduced down to running <code>semanage fcontext -a -t CONTEXT &quot;REGEX&quot;</code> once, and then running <code>restorecon -R PATH</code>. That&rsquo;s a lot less typing for the same effect, with the benefit of the rule being permanent, and transferable between reinstallations. The use of regular expressions is the only real part that&rsquo;s slightly more complex than using <code>chcon(1)</code>, but if you&rsquo;re playing about with SELinux then you should be the kind of user who knows or is learning regex anyway. Most of the paths you&rsquo;d want to use are either using wildcards <code>(.*)</code>, or spaces <code>[\s]</code>. The example below uses <code>(\.*)</code>, which matches both the parent directory and its contents, basically a short way of saying both <code>/mnt/storage/My Files</code> and everything inside of it.</p>

<pre><code>semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t &quot;/mnt/storage/My[\s]Files(\.*)?&quot;
restorecon -R /mnt/storage/My\ Files
</code></pre>

<p>Another useful rule is for the custom home-dir location. Say home directories are actually stored at <code>/mnt/storage/home</code>, you can run the following to get the context of this directory to persist.</p>

<pre><code>semanage fcontext -a -t home_root_t &quot;/mnt/storage/home&quot;
semanage fcontext -a -t user_home_t &quot;/mnt/storage/home/(.*)?&quot;
</code></pre>
