<p>This evening I was just lounging around thinking about BGP, as you do, and reminded myself about an interesting quirk in IP.</p>
<h1 id="whats-bgp-got-to-do-with-it">What&rsquo;s BGP got to do with it?</h1>
<p>The way I was taught BGP at University emphasised using Loopback interfaces to move the single-point-of-failure you&rsquo;d get physical interfaces, to a less-error prone virtual interface. In a basic two router lab setup with loopbacks implemented on both routers, this makes the network look something like the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/diagram_router_loopbacks.jpg" alt="Diagram of two routers with loopbacks"></p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s quriky about that? It gets a bit more interesting when you look at the configuration.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>router bgp 64496
	neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 64497
	neighbor 10.0.0.2 ebgp-multihop 2
	neighbor 10.0.0.2 update-source Loopback0
</code></pre><p>The interesting line is the one that says <code>ebgp-multihop 2</code>. You need to set that for EBPG when the neighbour is more than <code>1</code> hop away. This option is set to <code>2</code> hops, but in my brilliant diagram there&rsquo;s clearly three hops between <code>lo0</code> on <code>R1</code> and <code>lo0</code> on <code>R2</code>, and yet this works.</p>
<h1 id="what-the-shits-going-on">What the shit&rsquo;s going on?</h1>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot_router_async_traffic.png" alt="Screenshot of an asymmetric connection"></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening is that the routers are accepting and processing the packets at the interface nearest to the source, even if the destination address doesn&rsquo;t match that interface. This works, as long as the destination address matches <strong>any</strong> of that nodes interfaces. This is shown in the screenshot above, where an ICMP Echo enters the router via one interface, and the Echo-Reply leaves the router using a different interface, specifically the interface that has an address or route that&rsquo;s closer to the source address.</p>
<p>If you think about it, this way makes sense from a performance viewpoint because performing that extra hop for the packet to end up at essentially the same place is a bit inefficient.</p>
<p>This behaviour isn&rsquo;t just limited to routers either, it&rsquo;s also there on end-node stacks like the one in Linux. It&rsquo;s supposed to work that way.</p>
<h1 id="the-problems">The problems</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s no problems with the behaviour, in principle, but in practice things are a little shady. Because packets can come in on one interface, and be replied to from another, this opens up the possibility for someone to perform a blind attack against a node without the victim node even needing a route to the outside. This means that to be absolutely sure that your node can&rsquo;t receive unsolicited traffic, you have to be sure that none of the other nodes it can connect to have any connection to a lesser-trusted network.</p>
<p>Imagine that I&rsquo;ve sent an ICMP Echo packet to a node connected to two networks, one public, and one private (no routes to other networks, including public); but I&rsquo;ve spoofed the source address to that of a node on the private network and sent the packet from a node on the public network. The node I just pinged will send an Echo-Reply out onto the <strong>private</strong> network, from an event I triggered from outside.</p>
<p>Since anti-spoofing techniques are quite commonly implemented these days, and that blind attacks are one of the most difficult methods of doing any serious damage; knowing this information is kind of irrelevant, but interesting nonetheless.</p>
